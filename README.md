NodeSizer 
==========
*Caching ImageResizingProxy service running in node js.*

Server designed to provide a nice way of requesting images on the internet at a size you want. Designed and built in Node JS.
It's none blocking, so rolled on out on a CDN/Cloud will scale uniformly.

Trifolium (@dux) added
--------

Base64 URL cache safe paths

`http://localhost:8080/convert?source=http://i.imgur.com/2dD6DL5.jpg&size=350x350`

works as 

`http://localhost:8080/convert/300x300/aHR0cDovL2kuaW1ndXIuY29tLzJkRDZETDUuanBn.jpg`
`http://localhost:8080/convert/(size)/Base64(source).(jpg)`

Automatic crop if defined with and height `size=300x300`

Resize and automatic height if only with defined (default) `size=300`

To install

> git clone https://github.com/Trifolium/NodeSizer

> cd NodeSizer

> sudo node app.js


Currently supports
------------------

**bold** denotes required.

* **`source=`** the source file anywhere on the internet. (WebAddress)
* **`size=`** single or widthxheight e.g. '240' (finds the largest side) '240x360' will do it exact.
* `ext=` png,jpg,gif,tiff
* `quality=` 1-100 defaults to _80_ only works on jpeg, does a default 7 pass png optimisation.

An example request looks like 

`http://localhost:8080/convert?size=240&source=http://yoursite.com/media/yourimage.png`


**Headers**

* 1.0.1 - `Content-Creation-Time : [elapsed]` (Returns how long it took to create/return the image for you)
